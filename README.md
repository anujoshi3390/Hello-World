# Hello-World
Hi everyone, my name is Anu Joshi, and I’m excited to be starting my graduate studies at Boston University. My background is in geography and data science, and I’ve worked in both environmental science and technology—ranging from water chemistry research in marine labs to geospatial data projects at Apple Maps and NASA. I’m passionate about applying data-driven approaches to challenges in health, the environment, and global policy. Outside of academics, I love traveling, exploring new cities, and a good iced coffee. I’m really looking forward to learning with all of you and being part of the BU community.
